# workshop_chopshop
Tool for dealing with workshop items in Steam

The goal for this project is to allow for easy sharing of Steam workshop item lists. Inspired by trying to micromanage mod lists between friends in games like Stellaris. 

Long term goals:
1) Automatic link generation from the list of files - Working.
2) Being able to import as well as export mod lists
3) Simple interface for automatic (un)subscribe requests to the workshop
5) Separation and cleaning of mods that aren't subscribed any more (save disk space)
